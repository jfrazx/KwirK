look at 'agenda' for potential job/task scheduling
timer-jobs for simple timer operations // utilizing modified version written in TS - 09/09/15
nssocket as netSocket tls.TLSSocket replacement // needs some bug fixes for autoreconnect -- project does not seem to be very active
iconv-lite for more encoding options ?


all appear to need typescript definitions written

pipe socket data ? // probably not a good idea if I want to control flow ?

how do i write tests for network aspects?

extend winston for logging
implement sasl/nickserv/irc registration
implement transparent encryption layer w/ dhkey-exchange
server modules for networks
http server with client plugins
ssh bot interface, ability to issue bot commands, similar to eggdrop telnet console
bot to bot communication (bot networks)
support different chat protocols
multi-network/protocol (slack/hipchat to irc, etc) channel linking

better hook system: maybe hooks-js https://github.com/bnoguchi/hooks-js

find or create a time formatting library. example output  (start_time, end_time): 2 days, 3 hours and 45 minutes left.

much much more...
